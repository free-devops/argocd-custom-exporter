Thank you for installing the `argocd-custom-exporter` Helm chart!

1. To verify that the Deployment has been created:

kubectl get deployment -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ include "argocd-custom-exporter.fullname" . }}-deployment

2. Verify that the Service has been set up:

kubectl get service -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ include "argocd-custom-exporter.fullname" . }}

3. Verify that the ServiceMonitor has been created:

kubectl get servicemonitor -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ include "argocd-custom-exporter.fullname" . }}

4. To interact with the exporter locally:

kubectl port-forward deployment/{{ include "argocd-custom-exporter.fullname" . }}-deployment 8080:8080 -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}
Then open a browser or use a tool like 'curl' to access: http://localhost:8080/_system/metrics

Note: Make sure to configure your Prometheus instance to discover this ServiceMonitor if it's not set up to do so automatically.
